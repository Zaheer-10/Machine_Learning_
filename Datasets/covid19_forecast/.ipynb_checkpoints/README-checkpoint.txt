Facebook AI COVID-19 US County Projections

This data includes Covid-19 infection forecasts for US counties.
The forecasts are currently available for all counties in the United States where sufficient public data is available.
By sharing forecasts at a county-level, we protect individual privacy while empowering anyone viewing them to make informed decisions from the data.
We leverage a variety of AI techniques to produce robust predictions that can capture even rapid changes in a given area.
Our adaptive models capture short-term trends and take into account correlations between districts.
The forecasts are forward-looking up to 14 days from each weekly update we make.
We are sharing both the methodology and the projection data publicly and have a research paper detailing the techniques we used to generate the forecasts.
